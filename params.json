{"name":"Simulating birth and death","tagline":"Software for simulating birth and death processes for big particle ensembles","body":"\r\n### Welcome to our project page!\r\nThe goal of the project is allowing simulations wide class of birth and death processes in a microdynamic regime. These can be seen as a system of interacting particles where possible events include creation of new particle(birth) or removal of an existing one (death).\r\nThe occurrence of the events is dependent on every particle and can be either deterministic or stochastic.\r\n\r\nPlease note that jumps (i.e. moving a particle from one place to another in a discrete moment) is a combination both death and birth, and is also supported by the program.\r\n\r\nOut of many, possible applications include biological cell dynamics (cancer evolution, pattern formation), ecology (spreading of species), models from statistical physics or mathematics.\r\n\r\n### Main goals\r\n* Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy computation\r\n* Command Line Interface (CLI) for running advanced experiments\r\n* continuous space and time (up to the numerical precision)\r\n* 2D and 3D space in GUI or any-dimensional space in CLI\r\n* various models with different levels of generality \r\n* low memory footprint, overall efficiency\r\n* available for Windows, Linux and other compatible operating systems\r\n\r\n### Project status - ongoing development\r\n* GUI subproject reached early version \r\n([screenshot1](http://swing.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/~tozanski/simbad/Menu.jpg),\r\n[screenshot2](http://swing.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/~tozanski/simbad/Eventmaker.jpg),\r\n[screenshot3](http://swing.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/~tozanski/simbad/Simulation.jpg))\r\n* CLI is only available in old version \r\n([download animation1](http://swing.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/~tozanski/simbad/simple_gauss.mp4),\r\n[download animation2](http://swing.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/~tozanski/simbad/model_hs_density_preserved.mp4),\r\n[download animation3](http://swing.iiar.pwr.wroc.pl/~tozanski/simbad/model_hs_gauss.mp4)\r\n)    \r\n\r\n### Build requirements\r\n* cmake\r\n* C++ compiler with C++11 support (tested on g++ 4.8)\r\n* boost 1.54\r\n* Qt5 (GUI)\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n**Mykola Lebid**\r\n* Membership: Since 2012 PhD student, International Graduate College \"Stochastics and Real World Models\", Bielefeld University, Germany.\r\n* Research interests: Interactive particle systems; Probability theory; Fractal analysis\r\n\r\n**Tomasz Ożański**\r\n* PhD Student in Computer Science on Faculty of Electronics at Wrocław University of Technology, Poland \r\n* research interests: computational complexity, meta-programing, interacting particle systems simulations\r\n\r\n### More information\r\nDetailed information will be available soon on [our wiki page](https://github.com/biel-wro/SimBaD/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor information regarding graphical user interface and building the windows version please contact the authors Mykola Lebid (@mykolalebid) and Tomasz Ożański(@tozanski).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
