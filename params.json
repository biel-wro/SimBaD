{"name":"Simulating birth and death","tagline":"Software for simulating birth and death processes for big particle ensembles","body":"### Welcome to our project page!\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is allowing simulations wide class of birth and death processes in a microdynamic regime. These can be seen as a system of interacting particles where possible events include creation of new particle(birth) or removal of an existing one (death).\r\nThe occurrence of the events is dependent on every particle and can be either deterministic or stochastic.\r\n\r\nPlease note that jumps (i.e. moving a particle from one place to another in a discrete moment) or changing particles' properties is a combination of both death and birth, and is also supported by the program.\r\n\r\nOut of many, possible applications include biological cell dynamics (cancer evolution, pattern formation), ecology (spreading of species), models from statistical physics or mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe software can be considered as a pilot study for a forthcoming simulation framework for a tumor evolution and is developed as a part of the cooperation between Bielefeld University and [Wrocław University of Technology](http://www.pwr.wroc.pl), of simulating of interacting particle systems in continuum and application in cell dynamics. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Main goals\r\n* Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy computation\r\n* Command Line Interface (CLI) for running advanced experiments\r\n* continuous space and time (up to the numerical precision)\r\n* 2D and 3D space in GUI or any-dimensional space in CLI\r\n* various models with different levels of generality \r\n* low memory footprint, overall efficiency\r\n* available for Windows, Linux and other compatible operating systems\r\n\r\n### Project status - ongoing development\r\n* GUI subproject reached early version (see [screenshots](https://github.com/biel-wro/SimBaD/wiki/GUI-Screenshots) )\r\n* CLI is only available in old version   \r\n\r\nSome example results produced by the software can be viewed [here](https://github.com/biel-wro/SimBaD/wiki/Pattern-formation)\r\n\r\n### Build requirements\r\n* cmake\r\n* C++ compiler with C++11 support (tested on g++ 4.8)\r\n* boost 1.54\r\n* Qt5 (GUI)\r\nProject is built with cmake in the standard procedure.
