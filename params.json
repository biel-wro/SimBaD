{"name":"Simulating birth and death","tagline":"Software for simulating birth and death processes for big particle ensembles","body":"### Welcome to our project page!\r\nThe goal of the project is allowing simulations wide class of birth and death processes in a microdynamic regime. These can be seen as a system of interacting particles where possible events include creation of new particle(birth) or removal of an existing one (death).\r\nThe occurrence of the events is dependent on every particle and can be either deterministic or stochastic.\r\n\r\nPlease note that jumps (i.e. moving a particle from one place to another in a discrete moment) is a combination both death and birth, and is also supported by the program.\r\n\r\nOut of many, possible applications include biological cell dynamics (cancer evolution, pattern formation), ecology (spreading of species), models from statistical physics or mathematics.\r\n\r\n### Main goals\r\n* graphical and command-line user interface\r\n* continuous space and time (up to the numerical precision)\r\n* 2D and 3D space (GUI) or multidimensional space (CLI)\r\n* various models with different levels of generality \r\n* low memory footprint, overall efficiency\r\n* available for Windows, Linux and other compatible operating systems\r\n\r\n### Build requirements\r\n* cmake\r\n* C++ compiler with C++11 support (tested on g++ 4.8)\r\n* boost 1.54\r\n* Qt5 (GUI)\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n#####Mykola Lebid\r\n\r\n* Membership\r\n\r\nSince 2012 PhD student, International Graduate College \"Stochastics and Real World Models\", Bielefeld University, Germany.\r\n\r\n* Research interests\r\n\r\nInteractive particle systems; Probability theory; Fractal analysis\r\n\r\n### More information\r\nDetailed information will be available on [our wiki page](https://github.com/biel-wro/SimBaD/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor information regarding graphical user interface and building the windows version please contact the authors Mykola Lebid (@mykolalebid) and Tomasz Ożański(@tozanski).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
